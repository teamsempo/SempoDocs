# Ways to register participants

{% hint style="info" %}
In addition to collecting data for registering someone as a participant in your program, you will also need to collect data to enable Sempo to complete legally mandated[ "Know Your Customer"](../policies-and-security/compliance-aml-ctf/kyc.md) checks. A participant can be registered, but not able to cash out, if they have not had their KYC check completed yet.
{% endhint %}

There are four ways to register participants:

1. Sempo Dashboard 
2. Kobo Toolbox
3. Spreadsheet Upload
4. Self Sign Up \(if enabled\)

## 1.  Sempo Dashboard

**Step 1:** From the Sempo Dashboard, click on Accounts in the side-bar, and then “+ Add New” in the top right hand corner.

**Step 2:** Ensure that account type is set to “BENEFICIARY”  \(or what you would like your new participant to be\)

**Step 3:** Enter the user’s first name,  last name, and whatever other custom attributes your organisation may be tracking. 

If recipients will be logging into the Android app, add their phone number.  Alternatively, if they will be using a transfer card, you can enter the serial number manually, or click on the QR icon to scan a card using your browser’s camera.

**Step 4:** If you wish to disburse funds immediately, enter an amount. Alternatively, leave the value as 0.

{% hint style="info" %}
Note: The initial disbursement amount will be set to the default disbursement amount set in the organisation settings \([https://app.withsempo.com/settings/organisation](https://app.withsempo.com/settings/organisation)\)
{% endhint %}

**Step 5:** The confirmation screen will show a 4 digit PIN. If participants are using the Android App, tell them this pin, and they can use it along with their phone number to log into the app. Otherwise ignore the pin. This pin will also be sent via SMS to the participant.
