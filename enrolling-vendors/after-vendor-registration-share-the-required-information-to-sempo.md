# After registration, share vendor information with Sempo

## **Share collected vendor information for Sempo to conduct “KYC” checks**

After you have collected all vendor registration information, please email it in a CSV or Excel format to Sempo \(team@withsempo.com\), so we can conduct KYC checks. Please be aware that Sempo may require up to 5 business days to complete the requisite “Know Your Customer” checks. This process may be delayed if Sempo needs to ask you to provide more information about vendors. 

## Sync vendor details with the Sempo Dashboard

Sempo's partners can always upload and sync data about vendors and program participants on the Sempo Dashboard directly. 

Sempo can also assist you if you have any questions or concerns about the syncing process.
