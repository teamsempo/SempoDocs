# After registration, share vendor information with Sempo for KYC

## **Share collected vendor information for Sempo to conduct “KYC” checks**

After you have collected all vendor registration information, please email it in a CSV or Excel format to Sempo \(team@withsempo.com\), so we can conduct [ “Know Your Customer” \(KYC](../../policies-and-security/compliance-aml-ctf/kyc.md)\) checks. Please be aware that Sempo may require up to 5 business days to complete the requisite checks.

This process may be delayed if Sempo needs to ask you to collect more information about vendors.
