# Decide your vendor data collection mechanism with Sempo

## **Review and understand what information you need to collect** 

The following information must be collected on vendors for Sempo to complete legally-required "Know Your Customer" \(KYC\) checks. By working together with Sempo to collect and share this information, we can make sure that cash is being distributed in accordance with global standards.

* First Name
* Last Name
* Gender
* Date of Birth \(or residential address\)
* Phone number \(or email\)
* Bank Account Details, being
  * Bank Name
  * Bank Number
  * Account Number
  * Name of Account Holder 
* Photograph or PDF of a bank-issued document proving bank account ownership \(e.g. bank-issued card, bank statement\) 
* Photograph of original, government-issued Photo ID of the person. This could be their:
  * National ID, OR
  * Driver’s Licence, OR
  * Passport _Note: The image of the document should be the full image displaying all corners of the full document. Text and photos must be legible, and not blurry._ 
* Photograph of a vendor's face where the vendor is holding up the vendor’s Photo ID, and we see their face next to their Photo ID. This helps us match the vendor to their photo ID. 
  * _Note: The photograph must be a clear photograph of the vendor’s face and the Photo ID, well-lit and not blurry._
* Additional identification, depending upon the jurisdiction. \(Please confirm with team@withsempo.com for what the full range of requirements will be.\)

Sempo also enables our partners to collect additional information about vendors for tracking purposes. Please let us know whether you would like to collect such details as:

* Business Category for the Vendor \(e.g. Hardware store, or Fruit Store\) 
* Location

## Choose and set up your vendor data collection mechanism \(e.g. a form, or KoboToolbox Survey\) 

Sempo can enable that registration of vendors in four ways \(see [Registering Participants of your Program](../../sempo-dashboard/how-to-register-participants.md)\). 

Sempo recommends that our partners use KoboToolbox, Comcare or otherwise collect data in any CSV or Excel Spreadsheet. Sempo is then able to receive any spreadsheet and help you upload it to the Sempo Platform.

If you are unsure about how best to collect data and share it with Sempo, please ask us at [team@withsempo.com](mailto:team@withsempo.com) for help.
