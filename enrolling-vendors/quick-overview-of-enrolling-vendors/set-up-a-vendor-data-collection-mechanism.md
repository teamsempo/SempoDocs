# Decide your vendor data collection mechanism with Sempo

## **Review and understand what information you need to collect** 

The following information must be collected on vendors for Sempo to complete legally-required "Know Your Customer" \(KYC\) checks. By working together with Sempo to collect and share this information, we can make sure that cash is being distributed in accordance with global standards.

Please review our explanation of [KYC checks](../../policies-and-security/compliance-aml-ctf/kyc.md). In particular, Sempo requires the following data points to be collected:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style="text-align:left"><b>#</b>

      <th style="text-align:left">Data Points (documentation or information)</th>

Sempo also enables our partners to collect additional information about vendors for tracking purposes. Please let us know whether you would like to collect such details as:

* Business Category for the Vendor \(e.g. Hardware store, or Fruit Store\) 
* Location

## Choose and set up your vendor data collection mechanism \(e.g. a form, or KoboToolbox Survey\) 

Sempo can enable that registration of vendors in four ways \(see [Registering Participants of your Program](../how-to-register-participants.md)\).

Sempo recommends that our partners use KoboToolbox, Comcare or otherwise collect data in any CSV or Excel Spreadsheet. Sempo is then able to receive any spreadsheet and help you upload it to the Sempo Platform.

If you are unsure about how best to collect data and share it with Sempo, please ask us at [team@withsempo.com](mailto:team@withsempo.com) for help.
