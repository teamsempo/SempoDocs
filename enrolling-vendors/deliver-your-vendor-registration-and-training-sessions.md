### Welcome vendors 

Below is an example script you can use and tailor when introducing vendors to the Sempo platform. 

_“Welcome and thanks so much for coming today! As you know, we’d like to help more vulnerable people buy items from your store. We are going to give credits to people that they can spend at your store, and we will repay you for what people buy._ 

_We are giving vulnerable people contactless “tap to pay” cards, that are just like debit or credit cards._ 

_We are giving you, the vendors, a mobile phone with the Sempo app, that you can use to take payments for the items they buy. When someone wants to buy something from you, you will open up your mobile phone, open up the Sempo App, go to the “receiving card payment” page, type into the phone how much they have purchased \(and what they have purchased\). Then you will select “Touch to Pay Card”. Then your customer will tap their card against your phone and hold it against your phone for at least 5 seconds. If they have enough credits, the payment will be confirmed._ 

_Every week, we will exchange your credits for your local currency or preferred currency \(depending upon your bank account and cash-out method\).  
  
Today we have two hours to properly enrol you and train you, so you are ready to start receiving money. We are going to:  
\(1\) First collect some information from you, which will help us make sure that we can send you the money to your bank account  
\(2\) Sign vendor contracts with you \(if we haven’t already\)  
\(3\) Give you the mobile phone that you will be using, and show you how to use it  
\(4\) Practice receiving payments with you  
\(5\) Give you some advice about what to do if you encounter any issues.  
  
Are there any questions?”_

### **Gather data from vendors for enrolment and legally required “Know Your Customer” \(KYC\) checks**

Please use the vendor data collection mechanism that your organisation's lead \(or superadmin\) has designed and implemented with Sempo.

### **Give the vendors Vendor Agreements to sign and gather them**

Please provide a copy of the Vendor agreement for them to sign.

### **Give the Vendors their Mobile Phone, and help them log into the Sempo App for the first time**

Distribute the Android phones to vendors, and help them log in to the Sempo App. 

### **Practice receiving and making payments with the Vendor**



### **Explain the vendor reimbursement process and schedule to the Vendors**

We recommend explaining the vendor reimbursement process several times to vendors, until they are very comfortable and understand what is involved. An example of what you could say is:

_“As you receive payments from customers, you will see your balance increase in your Sempo wallet. Twice weekly, Sempo or our organisation will withdraw credits from your account and depositing local currency into your bank account._

_You will see that twice a week, a “withdrawal” transaction will appear in your account as “pending”. \(While it is pending, you won’t be able to spend or use those pending funds.\)  
  
When the transaction has been processed, the withdrawal will appear as “complete”._ 

_Please make sure that you connect to the internet every 1-2 days, so that we can make sure that we provide you with the full amount that you are owed.”_
