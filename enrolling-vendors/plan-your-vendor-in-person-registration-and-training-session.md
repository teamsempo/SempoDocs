# Plan your vendor registration and training session

## Planning your vendor registration session 

Sempo can help our partners organise in-person registration and training session for vendors. Steps for our partners to follow will include: 

1. Booking a suitable location
2. Contacting vendors, and providing enough notice about the timing of the event
3. Ensuring there will be WiFi \(or mobile phone hotspots\)
4. Ensuring all phone hardware has been prepared and delivered to the location before the session
5. Printing guides for Field Partners \(if required\)
6. Designing and printing guides for vendors \(if required\) 
7. Designing COVID-19 and other health and safety measures  

For the topics that will need to be covered with vendors, see next section.

## Creating a small number of demonstration vendor phone accounts and beneficiary cards/accounts, for training purposes 

It is useful to have a small number of demonstration vendor accounts and beneficiary accounts for training and testing purposes. The easiest way to do this is to simply create the accounts using the same steps that are described in this guide. In particular see:

* Setting up a vendor phone account
* Setting up a beneficiary account synced to a contactless card

Sempo can assist with disbursing a small amount of funds to your demonstration beneficiary accounts. We recommend having one demonstration beneficiary account and card per team member that will be enrolling vendors and beneficiaries in the field. Far fewer vendor accounts are generally required, but having one for testing is helpful.  
  
It is important to remember when setting up vendor and beneficiary accounts:

1. You should make the accounts easily identifiable for testing and training.We recommend using the names of the accounts for this purpose. For example “DEMO Beneficiary1” and  “DEMO Vendor1”. 
2. Make the cards you assign to demo beneficiary accounts clearly marked as “DEMO” cards. It is also extremely important that the cards that you assign to the demo beneficiary accounts do not get mixed in with the real cards - as they will not be able to be re-assigned to a beneficiary after training. We recommend marking the cards with a permanent marker immediately.

You do not need to log into the Sempo Mobile App using the phone number that belongs to the phone. It is easiest to create vendor accounts using a team-member's phone number.
