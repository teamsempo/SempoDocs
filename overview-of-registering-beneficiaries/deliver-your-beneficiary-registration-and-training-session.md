# Deliver your beneficiary registration and training session

After you have[ prepared](prepare-beneficiary-data-collection-mechanism/) for your beneficiary registration and training session, you will deliver your session. We advise the agenda for the session could address: 

1. Welcome and introductions \(approx. 30 mins, as a group\)
2. Interviews to collect data and distribute card \(1-5 minutes per beneficiary, 1:1\) 
3. Practice making payments \(20 minutes, recommended for 1 on 1\)
4. Explain Beneficiary payment schedule \(15 minutes, in a group\)
5. Review list of participating vendors in location  
6. Q&A and explanation of how beneficiaries should manage any issues as they arise \(15 minutes, as a group\) 

### Welcome vendors 

Below is an example script you can use and tailor when introducing beneficiaries to the Sempo platform. \(Note that this may change depending upon features of your program.\)

> _Welcome! It's wonderful to have you all here today for registration. As you know, we are going to give you money that you can use to buy more items from certain vendor stores over the coming months._ 
>
> _We are giving you contactless "tap to pay" cards. All you'll need to do is go to a participating vendor store, select the items you want to buy, take it to the vendor who will open up the Sempo App and type the amount that you owe them for the item. Hold your card against the vendor's phone still for at least 5 seconds. If you have enough credits, the payment will be confirmed._ 
>
> _Today we have time to register and practice making payments so you are comfortable with the cards and phones. We are going to:  
> \(1\) First collect some information from you and distribute your cards to you, which will  make sure we are sending cards to you  
> \(2\) Practice receiving payments with you  
> \(3\) Explain the payments schedule  
> \(4\) Review the list of vendors in your location that will be participating in this program  
> \(5\) Give you some advice about what to do if you encounter any issues.  
>   
> Are there any questions?”_

### **Gather data for registration \(and legally required “Know Your Customer” \(KYC\) checks, if relevant\)**

Please use the vendor data collection mechanism that your organisation's lead \(or superadmin\) has designed and implemented with Sempo. 

{% page-ref page="decide-your-beneficiary-data-collection-mechanism.md" %}



### **Give the vendors Vendor Agreements to sign and gather them**

Please provide a copy of the Vendor agreement for them to sign.

### **Give the Vendors their Mobile Phone, and help them log into the Sempo App for the first time**

Distribute the Android phones to vendors, and help them log in to the Sempo App. 

### **Practice receiving and making payments with the Vendor**

The best way to make sure vendors are comfortable accepting payments is to make several test payments using very small amounts of money \(for example $0.02 dollars\). We recommend that the vendor accept these payments using their own Sempo vendor accounts, and that your team members train vendors using a[ demonstration beneficiary account. ](../enrolling-vendors/quick-overview-of-enrolling-vendors/plan-your-vendor-in-person-registration-and-training-session.md#creating-a-small-number-of-demonstration-vendor-phone-accounts-and-beneficiary-cards-accounts-for-training-purposes)  
  
An example of how you can explain how to make payments to vendors is below:

> 1. _First, with the Sempo App open on your mobile phone, tap the button down the bottom with a dollar sign with the arrows around it to start a transaction._ 
> 2. _Then up the top of the Sempo app, check that you are set to receiving card payments. \(There are three icons at the topic. The icon on the right with the cards should be black.\)_ 
> 3. _Enter the exact amount you want to charge the customer._ 
> 4. _Then select charge._
> 5. _Then select the purchase categories. \(You can select multiple categories if multiple apply.\)_
> 6. _Then tap “Touch to Pay Card” \(to receive a payment from the customer by their card\)_
> 7. _Get the customer to hold their card against the back of the phone for up to 5 seconds, until you see a tick and a “Continue” button. \(Make sure your customer holds their card against the phone until the payment goes through.\)_
>
> _If you do not have an internet connection, the payment will be listed as “pending” until you are able to connect to the internet. This is OK - the payment will be saved on your phone. Once you’re online, pull down the screen to refresh the screen._

### **Explain the vendor reimbursement process and schedule to the Vendors**

We recommend explaining the vendor reimbursement process several times to vendors, until they are very comfortable and understand what is involved. An example of what you could say is:

> _“As you receive payments from customers, you will see your balance increase in your Sempo wallet. Twice weekly, Sempo or our organisation will withdraw credits from your account and depositing local currency into your bank account._
>
> _You will see that twice a week, a “withdrawal” transaction will appear in your account as “pending”. \(While it is pending, you won’t be able to spend or use those pending funds.\)  
>   
> When the transaction has been processed, the withdrawal will appear as “complete”._ 
>
> _Please make sure that you connect to the internet every 1-2 days, so that we can make sure that we provide you with the full amount that you are owed.”_

###  Q&A 

Here are some example answers you can give to potential beneficiary questions:

* **Q: I’ve lost my card. What should I do?** 
  * Answer: Contact our organisation \(or Field Partner\) immediately. We will be able to disable your  account from within the Sempo Dashboard, or ask Sempo for assistance. 
* **Q: I need to ask for a REFUND from a vendor. How do I do this?**
  * Answer: Contact our organisation \(or our Field Partners\) with your name, Sempo card number, the vendor's full name, the exact amount that needs to be refunded and the reason for refund. Our organisation can work with Sempo to resolve your issue.
