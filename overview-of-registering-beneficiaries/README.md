# Beneficiaries registration and training

## Overview of registering and training beneficiaries

After our partners have identified beneficiaries for the program, the next step is to register and train them. 

To deliver a successful beneficiary registration and training experience, Sempo can  work with our partners to:

1. Decide on the best beneficiary data collection mechanism \(e.g. CSV, KoboToolbox\)
2. Plan your beneficiary registration and training session
3. Deliver your beneficiary registration and training session
4. After registration, sync beneficiary data to the Sempo Dashboard

\(As of 2020, Sempo can only provide remote support due to COVID-19.\)
