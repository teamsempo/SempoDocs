# Adding Sempo Cards to Your Platform

{% hint style="info" %}
Sempo can sync your contactless cards for you to your Platform before we ship you the cards. This page explains how to complete this process in the circumstances where you have purchased cards that have not been synced to your Sempo Platform.
{% endhint %}

Before a beneficiary of your program can use a contactless card, we will need to: \(1\) Add it to your organisation's "instance" of the Sempo Platform being used for your program; and then \(2\) Add the card to that beneficiary's account on the Sempo Platform \(during registration\).

This page explains how to \(1\) Add a card to the relevant instance of the Sempo Platform. \(For \(2\) Adding cards to a beneficiary's account, see our[ beneficiary registration and training guide](../deliver-your-beneficiary-registration-and-training-session.md)\).

To add cards, you'll need a phone with an NFC scanner in it - just like the ones vendors will use.

### Logging into the Sync App

Sempo's Card Sync App is an easy way to add a card to the platform. It's actually hidden inside the regular Sempo Mobile App, but requires a special login process to use.

First, log into the Sempo Dashboard, and navigate to the Settings page. Then, click on the QR Code icon in the "Plugin/Integration Credentials" section. A QR code that can be used to login will appear:

Now, login to Sempo's Mobile App using any account. Then, navigate to settings, and press the "Sync" option near the bottom of the screen. A QR code scanner will appear. Point this at the QR code showing on the dashboard. After a few seconds, the words "Logged In" should appear in the top left corner of the screen. You're now ready to start adding cards!

### Adding a touch-to-pay card

First, point the QR Code Scanner of the Sync App at the QR Code on the back of a Sempo Touch-to-Pay card. The Card's Public Serial Number will appear on the screen.

Next, touch the card to the NFC scanner on your phone \(normally at the back\). Now the NFC ID will appear on the screen as well.

Once this is done, simply click "Send" to add the card, and your card will be added!
