# Disbursing to beneficiaries

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note:** Transfers made by an admin will only be _automatically approved_ if the value equals the default amount set on the system. See [Dashboard Settings](../sempo-dashboard/dashboard-overview/dashboard-settings.md).

{% hint style="success" %}
If you prefer, Sempo can also assist with making transfers to your beneficiaries according to your preferred schedule.

Superadmins can approve transfers by following the [Managing Transfers](managing-transfers/#approving-transfers) guide.
