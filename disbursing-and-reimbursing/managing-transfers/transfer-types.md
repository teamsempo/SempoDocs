# Transfer types

## **What are the different types of transfers?**

* **Payment** - a transfer between beneficiary and vendor, or vendor to vendor
* **Disbursement** - a transfer between NGO/Sempo and a beneficiary
* **Reclamation -** this occurs when Sempo or a partner “reclaims” value from a beneficiary or vendor \(e.g. because too much money has been incorrectly disbursed to them. While this isn’t technically a reversal of a transfer, it delivers the same effect.
* **Withdrawal -** a transfer between third party to the vendor, to enable them to “cash out” their credits into the local currency
* **Exchange** - exchange between two types of currencies.

### **What's the difference in purposes between a reclamation and withdrawal?** 

* **Reclamation -** The purpose of a reclamation is to correct a mistake. It is what the NGO will do to “reclaim” value from a beneficiary or vendor \(e.g. because money has been incorrectly disbursed to them\). 
* **Withdrawal -** The purpose of a withdrawal is to enable vendors to withdraw or “cash out”, and receive cash in exchange for their credits
