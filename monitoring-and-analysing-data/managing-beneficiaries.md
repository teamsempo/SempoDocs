# Viewing, filtering and editing participant accounts

## Viewing **the** accounts page

Once you have enrolled vendors and beneficiaries into your program, the accounts page should look something like this.

![Accounts page](../.gitbook/assets/screen-shot-2020-09-11-at-6.20.07-am.png)

Key features of this page are:

* You can select beneficiaries or vendors \(or both\)
* You can search for names
* You can see when accounts were created, and how much remaining balance is left
* You can add new user accounts
* You can also [export participant data into a CSV file.](exporting-to-excel.md)

**Note:** Vendor and beneficiary pages look virtually the same, but may include some different information \(such as store name\). 

## Filtering

From the accounts page, you are able to filter your searches, by selecting ![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/LX0zlF0NEQdj63SLFYLuk7AR4TBD2mda86HSCF0_kf9tjvB9A1qZwEwkxWEI5uNHSLHFYKnGWZlgseVgy_U-WMqzloWiu2o-JT4VXGbaECL7T-fadK0hLCYxmmWOwOPoXa1PNA4) from the top right hand corner, alongside the search bar. From here, you are able to select the required attributes.

## Viewing specific accounts

From the accounts page, you can click in the row of a participant, to be taken to the specific accounts page for that participant. From this page you can:

* Add/edit user information
* View specific transaction history
* Perform a new transfer

{% hint style="info" %}
You can register multiple users \(e.g. family members, cashiers\) under one account, if preferred.
{% endhint %}
