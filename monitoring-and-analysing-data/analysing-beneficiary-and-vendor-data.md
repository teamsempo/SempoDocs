# Analysing participant and transfer data

The Sempo analytics dashboard can be used to analyse participant and transfer data. It is also possible to [export a spreadsheet](exporting-to-excel.md) of all payments for further analysis in excel.

It is also important to conduct on-the-ground monitoring to ensure that the program has not resulted in adverse effects, such as beneficiaries being taken advantage of by vendors, or domestic violence due to the distribution.

## Analytics Dashboard Overview

The analytics page includes:

1. A "Master Wallet" that summarises the total amount disbursed, and total amount remaining
2. A Live Transaction Feed
3. A section to analyse Transfers 
4. A section to analyse Participants

## Analysing Transfers

Within the Transfers section, you can:

* Select the time period you want to analyse
* Filter the Data by certain attributes \(e.g. transfer usage, gender, transfer type or participant type\). When you filter, the filtered data will appear on the charts. 
* Group the data by certain attributes \(e.g. transfer usage, gender, transfer type or participant type etc\). When you group, the segmented data will appear on the charts in this section.
* Show total Volume of transfers over time. \(Just click "Volume"\)
* Show the total Transfer Count over time. \(Just click "Transfer Count"\)
* Show  unique participants over time. \(Just click "Unique Participants"\)
* Show Average Volume over time. \(Just click "Average Volume"\)
* Show Average Count over time. \(Just click "Average Count"\)

This enables complex and powerful queries to gain new insights into how your programs are performing for monitoring and evaluation. 

> For example, you could generate a query that **displays transaction volume over the current month**, grouped by **transfer usage**. You could filter this data to only display participants who are between the **ages of 25-40**, **female, in the town of Port Villa.** Then you could see what they have used their transfers for \(e.g. buying healthcare items, vs long-life food\)

## Analysing Participants 

Within the Participants section, you can also:

* Select the time period you want to analyse participants from
* Filter Participant Data 
* Group Participant data
* See total Active participants, over time \(click "Active Participants"\)
* See New Participants, over time \(click "New Participants"\)
