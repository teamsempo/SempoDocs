# What are our payment options?

## Payment options 

We support three key types of payment options:

1. **The Sempo Android app, which can run on any NFC-enabled Android Device.** This can be used by vendors to receive payments by beneficiaries. It can also be used for peer-to-peer transfers.
2. **USSD/SMS text-based messaging, which can run on any feature phone.** This means beneficiaries can send digital currency with something as simple as an SMS. 
3. **A contactless "tap-to-pay" card.** This can be used by beneficiaries to make purchases from vendors without any internet connection.

At this time, we only support Android devices \(iOS coming late 2020\).

The Near Field Communication \(NFC\) card is used primarily because it is a portable, familiar way to pay for goods and accept payments. The card is encrypted with the users unique code, so that it securely holds the balance of the users digital wallet.

When you order a batch of NFC cards, they are synced to your dashboard for use immediately. They can work in low or no connectivity environments for extended periods of time, until such time as the vendor wishes to be repaid.

## The Sempo Platform and Analytics Dashboard

The Sempo platform is run on a server which performs core functions and connects to a public blockchain.
