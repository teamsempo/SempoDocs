# Our payment options and dashboard

## Payment options 

We support four types of payment options:

1. The Sempo Android app, which can run on any NFC-enabled Android Device 
2. USSD text-based messaging, which can run on any feature phone
3. SMS messaging, which can run on any feature phone
4. A contactless "tap-to-pay" card, which can store users balance and make purchases without any internet connection

At this time, we only support Android devices \(iOS coming late 2020\).

## The Sempo platform and dashboard

The Sempo platform is run on a server which performs core functions and connects to a public blockchain.

The Near Field Communication \(NFC\) card is used primarily because it is a portable, familiar way to pay for goods and accept payments. The card is encrypted with the users unique code, so that it securely holds the balance of the users digital wallet.

When you order a batch of NFC cards, they are synced to your dashboard for use immediately. They can work in low or no connectivity environments for extended periods of time, until such time as the vendor wishes to be repaid.
