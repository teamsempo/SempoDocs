# Solving Problems with the App

### **When the Beneficiary tries to pay, I see "Touched too fast".**

* The Beneficiary did not hold the card to the phone for long enough.
* Press the "Try Again", and try the payment again.
* Make sure the Beneficiary holds the card to the phone until the payment completes.
* IMPORTANT: If you see "Touched too Fast", try not to exit the payment screen without trying again. If you exit, the beneficiary card might finish with the wrong balance. Only exit if you have tried to pay with the beneficiary holding the card for a long time.

### **When the Beneficiary tries to pay, I see "Card Authentication Error".**

* The Sempo App might need more information about this card. Return to the Home Screen and refresh by pulling down on the Payment List. Make sure you wait a few minutes for the information to completely load.
* After waiting a few minutes, try to make the payment again.
* If you still see "Card Authentication Error", there might be something wrong with the card. Please contact Oxfam.

### When the Beneficiary tries to pay, I see "New Card Found".

* The Sempo App has discovered a new card. It has already loaded more information about this card. You can try to make the payment again immediately.

### After making a payment, the balance on the Beneficiary's Card has gone down, but no payment appears on the app.

* There was a problem with the payment. Contact Oxfam and tell them:
  * The Card Number
  * The amount the payment was for
  * What the balance on the card was after the payment.
* If you see this a lot, it is probably because beneficiaries are not holding the card for long enough. Make sure they are holding the card until the payment completes.

### After making a payment, the payment shows on the app as "Pending".

* The phone does not have an internet connection, and so cannot complete the payment.
* Don't worry! Your payment is saved on the phone and will complete once the phone has internet.
* IMPORTANT:  A payment will only be reimbursed once it is complete. If a payment is pending when a reimbursement is made, it will be in a later reimbursement instead.

### When I try to log in, I see "Unknown Error".

* The Sempo App sometimes needs the internet when logging in, to download critical information. Find a stronger internet connection and try to log in again.

### I’ve received a payment, but I need to make a refund to a beneficiary. 

* Notify Oxfam of the name of the customer, and the exact amount owed.
* Oxfam will reverse the transaction within the next 24 hours. 

### I want to export my data to an excel.

* Go to the settings page and click "Export Data"
* Enter an email address and click the button. You will receive an email with a spreadsheet link \(expires in 24 hours\). This contains all transfers on the account with data. Specifically: Transfer Amount, Created, Resolved Date, Transfer Type, Transfer Use, Transfer Status.  ![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/xVAOQ3LbWtgsyuoLP76w06GgcldSjrybuHKZihhF-qI1Tf00AczlQlAngWSpPVGjhvnsX70PlCApkassv4vxiORWrTaqEJgH-Ymg3lm3nn1kg2XetSwNEFx7qICbcXNuEQdChT26)

### I don’t know what my PIN is for logging into the Sempo App on the first occasion.

* We have set your PIN to the last four digits of your phone number. Upon logging in, you will be given the option to change your PIN number to a secure number. Please keep your new PIN number in a secure location.

### I've forgotten my PIN. What should I do?

* Contact Oxfam, who can work with Sempo to resolve your issue. It may take up to 5 business days to resolve your issue.

### I’ve lost my phone / my phone has been stolen. What should I do?

* Contact Oxfam immediately. We will be able to disable your account from within the Sempo Dashboard, or ask Sempo for assistance.

### What are the two other options that I see when I open my Sempo Wallet to the transactions page? When would I use the QR Code or send money to someone else?

* The QR code is a code that you could use to accept payment from another vendor or person with the Sempo app on an Android phone. The paper plane /arrow icon indicates the way that you could send a payment as a vendor to another person with the Sempo App.

### I am having some other issue, what should I do?

* Many problems can be solved by restarting the Sempo app. Close and restart the Sempo App, and try again. \(Like most pieces of technology giving it a chance to “refresh” can help!\)
