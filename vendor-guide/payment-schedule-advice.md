# Payment Schedule Advice

Thank you for participating in this project that seeks to support your community! Through this economic aid and your participation, we support families so that they can have access to varied and quality food, and improve the nutrition of their homes. 

**Where will you deposit the money from my sales?** 

The money accumulated from your sales will be deposited in the bank account you nominated.

**How do I know that my money will actually reach my account?**

One week before starting the project, we will do a test transfer to make sure the bank details are correct. 

**How often will my sales money be deposited?** 

If you are a vendor in Venezuela, your money will be deposited two times a week \(on Mondays and Thursdays\).

If you are a vendor in PNG or Vanuatu, your money will be deposited once a week. 

**How do I know how much will be deposited?**

The Sempo payment system will withdraw the accumulated sales from your mobile phone Sempo account and send it to the bank. You can check your balance on your mobile phone and know how much you will be paid on each payday. 

**Why does the balance appear in dollars?**

This project works with dollar currency to prevent the money from buyers and merchants from being devalued. By keeping your earnings in dollars, we prevent it from depreciating week by week. 

**At what rate should I charge customers and why?**

To keep your money in dollars, we use a digital wallet. That digital wallet belongs to the AirTM platform and so we set the AirTM exchange rate for the sale. 

**Where can I check that exchange rate daily?** 

By going to https://rates.airtm.io or asking the project coordination team. We plan to open a WhatsApp group to coordinate. 

**At what rate will I be paid for my sales?**

At the AirTM rate on that payday \(3-4 days after the sale\). 

**Why is this rate lower than the monitor dollar rates?** 

The AirTM rate is based on an online marketplace, and depends on the supply and demand of customers using that platform to buy and sell money. The platform offers the advantage that it is secure \(fraud risk is mitigated\) and provides its users with money available for currency exchange 7 days a week, 24 hours a day. If you are interested, we can help you open your own account or wallet online in the future, so that your money is always in dollars, until you decide to change it to Bolivars. 

**How can I be sure that at the end of the month I won't have lost any money?** 

The team will be constantly monitoring the exchange rate and payments throughout the month, to ensure that you are paid fairly for your sales. In the pilot test in Zulia, so far, the merchants have not asked for money, but they have increased their sales.
