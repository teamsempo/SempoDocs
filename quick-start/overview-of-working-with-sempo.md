{% hint style="info" %}
 In reality, phases may overlap and activities may occur at the same time as each other. 
{% endhint %}

## A. Scoping and Contracting 

During this phase, it is important that Sempo and our partners:

* Discuss the key objectives and characteristics of the cash transfer program 
* Discuss the financial processes, flow of funds, preferred currency and cash-out method 
* Finalise contracts

We also recommend that our Partners:

* Write Standard Operating Procedures \(SOPs\)
* Clarify the roles and responsibilities of Field Partners 
* Establish communications with other key stakeholders, such as peer and government agencies
* Establish community presence and community accountability and reporting mechanisms  
* Establish a monitoring and evaluation framework 

For further guidance, we recommend reviewing Mercy Corps' [Cash Transfer Implementation Guide. ](https://www.mercycorps.org/sites/default/files/2019-11/CashTransferImplementationGuide.pdf)

Sempo cannot procure hardware for you or deliver training until contracts are finalised.

## B. Project Design, Training and Onboarding 

### Checklist of key Project Design questions to discuss with Sempo

During the initial kick-off meeting with Sempo for project design, we will discuss the following questions.

| **Category** | Question to discuss |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Participants** | How will you be identifying and selecting participants? |
| \*\*\*\* | What will be the total number of vendors, per location? |
|  | How much will be disbursed to beneficiaries? How often? \(e.g. $100 USD per month\) |
|  | What is the currency that we will be "cashing out" vendors into? |
|  | How would you and vendors prefer that we "cash out" vendors? \(e.g. transferring to their bank accounts\) |
|  | Frequency of "cashing out" of vendors? \(e.g. weekly, bi-weekly\) |
|  | Will we enable vendors to cash each other out? If so, how many vendors will be enabled to do this? |

| **Hardware** | How will beneficiaries receive disbursements? \(e.g. by card, by card AND app\) |
|  | How many cards would you like to order for beneficiaries? \(We recommend ordering an additional 10% for safe-keeping\). |
|  | If cards, do you want these cards to be branded cards, or unbranded cards with QR code stickers? |
|  | How many NFC-enabled smartphones would you like to order for vendors? \(We recommend ordering an additional 5% for safe-keeping\).  |

| **Internet connection** | Will vendors be able to connect their mobile phones to the internet at least once every 1-2 days? |
|  | Will you be needing to procure SIMs to provide internet connection to vendors? |
| **Processes and Tools** | What processes and tools do you plan to use for pre-program interviewing of participants \(e.g. KoboToolbox, Commcare\)? |
|  | Sempo can support [four ways to register participants. ](https://docs.withsempo.com/enrolling-vendors/how-to-register-participants)What way do you plan to use for registering participants? \(e.g. KoboToolbox, CSV\)? |
| **Identity verification for KYC** | Will vendors have access to current government-issued Photo ID, for the purposes of[ Know Your Customer \(KYC\) checks?](../policies-and-security/kyc.md) |
|  | Will vendors have access to proof of bank account ownership, for the purposes of [Know Your Customer \(KYC\) checks?](../policies-and-security/kyc.md) |
|  | Do you expect many vendors to need to cash out more than $500 per week or $1000 AUD per month? \([They will need further verification\)](../policies-and-security/kyc.md) |
| **Digital literacy**  | How familiar are you and your team with using Android smartphones?  \(This helps us plan for tailoring training.\) |
|  | How familiar are your Field Partners with using Android smartphones? \(This helps us plan for tailoring training.\) |
|  | How familiar are vendors with using smartphones or feature phones? |
| **Field Partners** | Will you be engaging Field Partners in any locations? When? |
|  | What are the roles and responsibilities of these Field Partners vs your team vs Sempo? |
| **Participant service** | Who will be supporting your program participants in the Field throughout the program?  |
|  | What ongoing support will be provided? \(e.g. customer support hotline, town halls\) |
| **M&E Frameworks** | What metrics and reports do you anticipate you will want and need from the Sempo Analytics Dashboard? \(Sempo will make sure that we train you in using the [analytics dashboard](../monitoring-and-analysing-data/analysing-beneficiary-and-vendor-data.md) and [exporting the data y](../monitoring-and-analysing-data/exporting-to-excel.md)ou need to help you with your reports.\) |
|  | What on-the-ground monitoring will you be doing? |
| **Ways of Working** | What is the preferred meeting tool for us to use? \(e.g. Skype, Zoom\) |
|  | What is the preferred way for us to store data that we share with each other in compliance with privacy laws? \(We suggest GDrive\) |
|  | What is your preferred cadence for meeting with us? \(We suggest weekly 45 min meetings during set-up\) |

In reality, a lot of these features may change during the course of our engagement. But we find it helpful to discuss this list of characteristics at the start of the project and on an ongoing basis, to manage expectations.

### Training Agenda

Sempo will then organise trainings with you and your Field Partners to ensure you are comfortable with: 

* Using the Sempo Dashboard, in particular:
  * Understanding the [access tiers](../sempo-dashboard/dashboard-overview/access-tiers.md) of the Dashboard
  * [Signing up for accessing](../sempo-dashboard/how-to-log-in/) the Dashboard
  * [Inviting someone to access the Dashboard](../sempo-dashboard/accessing-the-dashboard-1.md)
  * [Viewing, filtering and editing participant account](../monitoring-and-analysing-data/managing-beneficiaries.md)
  * [Analysing participant and transfer data](../monitoring-and-analysing-data/analysing-beneficiary-and-vendor-data.md)
  * [Exporting data to excel](../monitoring-and-analysing-data/exporting-to-excel.md)
  * [Integrating with Kobo Toolbox \(if required\)](../integrations/kobotoolbox.md)
  * [Understanding the transfer types](../transferring-cash-to-participants/transfer-types.md)
* Using the Sempo Mobile App, in particular
  * [Installing the app](../mobile-app/installing-android-devices-with-the-sempo-app.md)
  * [Navigating the app](../mobile-app/app-navigation.md)
  * [Using the app as a vendor](../mobile-app/using-the-app-as-a-vendor.md)
  * [Using the app as a beneficiary](../mobile-app/using-the-app-as-a-beneficiary.md)
* Preparing the [best process for registering participants](../registering-vendors-and-beneficiaries/how-to-register-participants.md), so you can:
  * Deliver [vendor registration and training](../registering-vendors-and-beneficiaries/quick-overview-of-enrolling-vendors/)
  * Deliver [beneficiary registration and training ](../registering-vendors-and-beneficiaries/overview-of-registering-beneficiaries/) 

Sempo can also deliver training for your financial accounting partners, if required. 

### Onboarding 

You and your Field Partners will then register and train program participants. After collection of identity documentation \(typically during registration\). Sempo will then complete ["Know Your Customer" \(KYC\) checks](../policies-and-security/kyc.md) of your program participants, in compliance with relevant global standards and laws. Sempo requires at least 5 business days to complete KYC checks.

For vendors who do not pass[ Level 2 verification](../policies-and-security/kyc.md#what-are-sempos-transaction-limits), they will still be able to receive payments and cash out from other vendors, but they will not be able to receive bank transfers. 

## C. Distribution and Monitoring 

After your program participants are registered, we are ready to begin disbursing funds to beneficiaries and withdrawing/reimbursing vendors!

In this stage, we will work together to:

* [Manage transfers](../transferring-cash-to-participants/managing-transfers.md)
* [Disburse funds to beneficiaries](../transferring-cash-to-participants/disbursing-funds.md)
* Conduct [vendor withdrawals and reimbursements](../transferring-cash-to-participants/vendor-reimbursement-1.md)
* [Analyse participant and transfer data](../monitoring-and-analysing-data/analysing-beneficiary-and-vendor-data.md)

Where possible, we recommend planning for a week-long "mini-pilot" or week where a small number of beneficiaries have a shopping week at certain vendors. This can allow for testing and adaptation of our solution as required to your context.

## D. Reporting and Preparing for Extension

We can work with you to analyse and report on participant and transfer data collected via our Platform. 

Sempo can:

* Deliver an end-point survey for feedback from partners 
* Deliver a retrospective workshop to reflect on feedback
* Develop a learnings report 
* Assist with donor reports and fundraising strategies for scale-ups.

Please note: we also encourage our partners to conduct on-the-ground monitoring to ensure that the program has not resulted in adverse effects, such as beneficiaries being taken advantage of by vendors, or domestic violence due to the distribution. Please conduct us at team@withsempo.com to discuss ways we can help you.
