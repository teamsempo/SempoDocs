## Transfer Types

What are the different types of transfers?

* **Payment -** a transfer between beneficiary and vendor, or vendor to vendor
* **Disbursement -** a transfer between NGO and a beneficiary
* **Reclamation -** this occurs when the NGO “reclaims” value from a beneficiary \(e.g. because too much money has been incorrectly disbursed to them. While this isn’t technically a reversal of a transfer, it delivers the same effect\)
* **Withdrawal -** a transfer between third party to the vendor, to enable them to “cash out” their credits into Vatu. \(This detail will only be shown on designed administrator accounts\)
* **Exchange -** exchange between two types of currencies.
* **Fee -** a transfer that is a fee \(i.e. currency conversion fees\)
* **Incentive** - a transfer that is a program incentive \(i.e. incentive for vendors\)
