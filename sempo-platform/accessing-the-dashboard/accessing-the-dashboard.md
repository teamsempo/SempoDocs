# Inviting someone to access the Sempo Dashboard

{% hint style="warning" %}
**To get access to the dashboard ask your platform administrator to invite you and then** [**sign up**.](how-to-log-in.md) If you need help, please reach out to [help@withsempo.com](mailto:help@withsempo.com).
{% endhint %}

Superadmins and admins can invite others to join the Sempo Dashboard. To invite others, please:

1. Navigate to the Settings Page 
2. Select ‘+ New User’
3. Enter the New User's email address, and choose their tier. \(See [Access Tiers](access-tiers.md) for guidance if you don't know which tier to invite them to.\)
4. If a user doesn't get an email, try resending it and ask them to check their spam inbox.
