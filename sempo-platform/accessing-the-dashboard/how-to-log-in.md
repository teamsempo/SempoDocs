# How to log in

{% hint style="info" %}
This is the guide for **admin users** of the Sempo platform.
{% endhint %}

1. Ask your superadmin to invite you to your organisation's Sempo instance
2. Click on the invite link in your email inbox
3. Sign up and set a secure password

**Note: For superadmins, you need to set a two-factor authentication \(TFA\) code for increased security. We reccomend Google Authenticator.**

> Google Authenticator is a software-based authenticator by Google that implements two-step verification services using the Time-based One-time Password Algorithm.

DO NOT delete the Google Authenticator mobile app or codes without first changing devices or disabling Two Factor Authentication.
