## **What are the different types of transfers?**

* **Payment** - a transfer between [beneficiary and vendor](../mobile-app/using-the-app-as-a-beneficiary.md), or [vendor to vendor](../vendor-guide/vendor-guide/using-the-app-as-a-vendor.md#how-to-cash-out-another-vendor)
* **Disbursement** - a transfer between NGO/Sempo and a beneficiary
* **Reclamation -** a transfer when NGO/Sempo takes back or “reclaims” value from a beneficiary or vendor, because too much money has been incorrectly disbursed to them. \(While this isn’t technically a reversal of a transfer, it delivers the same effect.\) 
* **Withdrawal -** a withdrawal of funds from a vendor, occuring at the same time as a transfer from a third party to the vendor, which will enable the vendor to “cash out” their credits into their preferred/local currency
* **Exchange** - an exchange between two types of currencies

### **What's the difference in purposes between a reclamation and withdrawal?** 

* **Reclamation -** The purpose of a reclamation is to correct a mistake. It is what the NGO will do to “reclaim” value from a beneficiary or vendor \(e.g. because money has been incorrectly disbursed to them\). 
* **Withdrawal -** The purpose of a withdrawal is to enable vendors to withdraw or “cash out”, and receive cash in exchange for their credits
