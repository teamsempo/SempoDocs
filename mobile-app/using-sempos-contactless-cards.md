### How to use Sempo's Tap-to-Pay cards?

1. Go Shopping! **Look for vendors** that support Sempo.
2. Once **you're ready to pay**, the **vendor will enter the amount and the category of your purchase** into the app on their phone.

3. To pay just **tap your card** anywhere on the vendor's phone. Hold it still for 5 seconds.

**4. Congratulations!** Vendors will show you payment confirmation and the remaining balance on your card.
