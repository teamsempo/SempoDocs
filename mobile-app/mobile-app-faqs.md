# Mobile App FAQs & Troubleshooting

## Online vs Offline Functionality?

**Online Payments** are the _default payment_ method. Transactions sync in real-time with the dashboard and blockchain.

**Offline Payments** are the _fallback payment_ method. Transactions occur on the Vendor device and increment the card balance to prevent the beneficiary double-spending funds across multiple vendors. Once the Vendor has internet, the transaction will sync with the dashboard and the blockchain.

Once you have initiated a transfer you can not cancel it. This includes in-store payments, peer-to-peer payments and international transfers.

If you need to change the amount you sent or refund a customer for an incorrect charge, please initiate a new payment of that amount to the individuals phone number or unique code.
