## How to give a refund

If a vendor needs to refund a customer \(eg. if they accidentally overcharged\), the vendor needs to:

1. Notify the organisation managing the cash transfer program of the name of the customer, and the exact amount owed. 
2. The organisation and/or Sempo can perform a reclamation of the amount from the vendor, and then disburse the owed amount to the customer
