 In reality, phases may overlap and activities may occur at the same time as each other.

## A. Scoping and Contracting 

During this phase, it is important that Sempo and our partners:

* Discuss the key objectives and characteristics of the cash transfer program 
* Finalise contracts

We also recommend that our Partners:

* Draft and finalise their Standard Operating Procedures \(SOPs\)
* Clarify the roles and responsibilities of Field Partners 
* Establish communications with other key stakeholders, such as peer and government agencies
* Establish community presence and community accountability and reporting mechanisms  
* Establish a monitoring and evaluation framework 

For further guidance, we recommend reviewing Mercy Corps' [Cash Transfer Implementation Guide. ](https://www.mercycorps.org/sites/default/files/2019-11/CashTransferImplementationGuide.pdf)
