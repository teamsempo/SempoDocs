 In reality, phases may overlap and activities may occur at the same time as each other. 
{% endhint %}

## A. Scoping and Contracting 

During this phase, it is important that Sempo and our partners:

* Discuss the key objectives and characteristics of the cash transfer program 
* Finalise contracts

We also recommend that our Partners:

* Draft and finalise their Standard Operating Procedures \(SOPs\)
* Clarify the roles and responsibilities of Field Partners 
* Establish communications with other key stakeholders, such as peer and government agencies
* Establish community presence and community accountability and reporting mechanisms  
* Establish a monitoring and evaluation framework 

For further guidance, we recommend reviewing Mercy Corps' [Cash Transfer Implementation Guide. ](https://www.mercycorps.org/sites/default/files/2019-11/CashTransferImplementationGuide.pdf)

{% hint style="warning" %}
Sempo cannot procure hardware for you or deliver training until contracts are finalised.
{% endhint %}

## B. Project Design, Training and Onboarding 

During this stage, you will be engaged in design of your cash transfer program, in particular:

* Setting targeting criteria for participants 
* Identifying and selecting participants \(beneficiaries/households and vendors\)
* Training your personnel in CTP and MEAL fundamentals
* Engaging donors and raising community awareness
* Finalising your hardware order with Sempo

Sempo will train our Partners in:

* Using the Sempo Dashboard, in particular:
  * Understanding the [access tiers](sempo-dashboard/dashboard-overview/access-tiers.md) of the Dashboard
  * [Signing up for accessing](sempo-dashboard/how-to-log-in/) the Dashboard
  * [Inviting someone to access the Dashboard](sempo-dashboard/accessing-the-dashboard-1.md)
  * [Viewing, filtering and editing participant account](analytics-and-meal/managing-beneficiaries.md)
  * [Analysing participant and transfer data](analytics-and-meal/analysing-beneficiary-and-vendor-data.md)
  * [Exporting data to excel](analytics-and-meal/exporting-to-excel.md)
  * [Integrating with Kobo Toolbox \(if required\)](integrations/kobotoolbox.md)
  * [Understanding the transfer types](disbursing-and-withdrawing/transfer-types.md)
* Using the Sempo Mobile App, in particular
  * [Installing the app](mobile-app/installing-android-devices-with-the-sempo-app.md)
  * [Navigating the app](mobile-app/app-navigation.md)
  * [Using the app as a vendor](mobile-app/using-the-app-as-a-vendor.md)
  * [Using the app as a beneficiary](mobile-app/using-the-app-as-a-beneficiary.md)
* Preparing the [best process for registering participants](enrolling-vendors/how-to-register-participants.md)
* Delivering [vendor registration and training](enrolling-vendors/quick-overview-of-enrolling-vendors/)
* Delivering [beneficiary registration and training ](enrolling-vendors/overview-of-registering-beneficiaries/) 

Sempo will then complete ["Know Your Customer" \(KYC\) checks](policies-and-security/compliance-aml-ctf/kyc.md) of your program participants, in compliance with relevant global standards and laws.

## C. Distribution and Monitoring 

After your program participants are registered, we are ready to begin disbursing funds to beneficiaries and withdrawing/reimbursing vendors!

In this stage, we will work together to:

* [Manage transfers](disbursing-and-withdrawing/managing-transfers.md)
* [Disburse funds to beneficiaries](disbursing-and-withdrawing/disbursing-funds.md)
* Conduct [vendor withdrawals and reimbursements](disbursing-and-withdrawing/vendor-reimbursement-1.md)
* [Analyse participant and transfer data](analytics-and-meal/analysing-beneficiary-and-vendor-data.md)

Where possible, we recommend planning for a week-long "mini-pilot" or week where a small number of beneficiaries have a shopping week at certain vendors. This can allow for testing and adaptation of our solution as required to your context.

## D. Reporting and Preparing for Extension

We can work with you to analyse and report on participant and transfer data collected via our Platform. 

Sempo can:

* Deliver an end-point survey for feedback from partners 
* Deliver a retrospective workshop to reflect on feedback
* Develop a learnings report 
* Assist with donor reports and fundraising strategies for scale-ups.

Please note: we also encourage our partners to conduct on-the-ground monitoring to ensure that the program has not resulted in adverse effects, such as beneficiaries being taken advantage of by vendors, or domestic violence due to the distribution. Please conduct us at team@withsempo.com to discuss ways we can help you.
