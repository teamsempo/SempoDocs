# Know Your Customer \(KYC\) checks

## What is a KYC check and who needs to do it?

AML/CTF laws impose obligations on Financial Service Providers to perform Know Your Customer \(KYC\) checks, sometimes called customer due diligence. The exact types of information that must be collected and checks that must be performed are set out in  national laws, and so they vary across jurisdictions. 

Whenever a organisation wishes to partner with a Financial Service Provider, the provider will be bound by AML, CTF and KYC regulations.  
  
By working with Sempo to satisfy AML/CTF and KYC regulations, our partners can be assured cash is being distributed in compliance with global standards.

## What are Sempo's Transaction Limits?

We implement strict velocity exchange limits, ensuring that the rapid exchange of a large amount of currency is impossible for a single individual or small group of individuals. In addition, there are transaction limits in place to ensure that only fully verified users have access to the full service.

Please note: Level 0 and 1 are suitable for beneficiaries, who will not be "cashing out" their credits into fiat currency. Level 2 and 3 are suitable for vendors or any persons who will be "cashing out" into fiat currency.

## What KYC checks does Sempo perform?

Sempo completes four types of KYC checks:

1. Ensuring that the information provided on the person is authentic, valid and current
2. Ensuring that the person is not a Politically Exposed Person
3. Ensuring that the person is not on any Global Sanctions List \(e.g. Interpol's Most Wanted, UN Consolidated List\)
4. Ensuring there is no adverse media on the person 

 We engage third-party identity and document verification providers such as Namescan. These providers offer reliable in-class document verification services using advanced scanning tools and extensive data sources.

## What data points does Sempo typically require to complete KYC checks?

We collect up to ten data points, depending upon the desired level of verification and transaction limit for the participant.

We only accept an identification document that has not expired \(the exception to this is an Australian passport that has expired within the preceding two years\).

If we use an electronic-based verification process, we need to verify the following using reliable and independent electronic data:

* customer’s name from at least two separate data sources; and
* customer’s residential address and/or date of birth from at least two separate data sources. 

For high-risk customers, we conduct further KYC and due diligence. This will depend on the client and the particular reason for the high-risk rating. For example, we may take the following additional KYC checks for high risk individuals:

* checking any other names that customer is known by;
* customer’s countries of citizenship or residence;
* customer’s occupation nor business activities;
* income or assets of the customer; or
* beneficial ownership of funds.
