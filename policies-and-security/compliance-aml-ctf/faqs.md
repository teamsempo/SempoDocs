## How does the Sempo system work?

The Sempo system enables funds to be transferred digitally into a customers digital wallet. We use a suite of digital currencies \(or just blockchain tracking when regulations don't allow digital currency\) that enable people to transact safely and securely.

You can access your digital wallet via the Sempo App, and make everyday purchases at Sempo verified vendors, simply by scanning a QR code.
