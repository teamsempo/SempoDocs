# Compliance Processes

Sempo is registered with the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre \(AUSTRAC\) as a Digital Currency Exchange \(DCE\) 100617044-001.

As such, Sempo is subject to stringent regulations and requirements with respect to managing the risk of potentially being used to facilitate money laundering \(ML\), terrorist financing \(TF\) or other criminal activity. It is our responsibility to effectively identify and mitigate risks to protect our users.

## Know Your Customer \(KYC\) Requirements

### Recipients

Recipients with no KYC information are limited to receiving “vouchers” that are only spendable within a small community at a selection of vendors.

### Vendors

For vendors, a more detailed enrollment process is required than of recipients, which involves collecting KYC \(Know Your Customer\) documentation.

Vendors are able to submit their own KYC details and documents via the Sempo App as part of their registration process. You can also submit KYC information via KoboToolbox or the dashboard. The platform will automatically assess the documentation and either approve or reject the request.

### Account Limits

As part of managing our risk and financial compliance, all accounts on the Sempo platform are subject to account limits.
