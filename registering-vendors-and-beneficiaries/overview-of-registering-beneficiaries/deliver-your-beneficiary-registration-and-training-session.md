# Deliver beneficiary registration and training session

After you have[ prepared](prepare-beneficiary-data-collection-mechanism.md) for your beneficiary registration and training session, you will deliver your session. We advise the agenda for the session could address: 

1. Welcome and introductions \(approx. 30 mins, as a group\)
2. Interviews to collect data and distribute card \(1-5 minutes per beneficiary, 1:1\) 
3. Practice making payments \(20 minutes, recommended for 1 on 1\)
4. Explain Beneficiary payment schedule \(15 minutes, in a group\)
5. Review list of participating vendors in location  
6. Q&A and explanation of how beneficiaries should manage any issues as they arise \(15 minutes, as a group\) 

## Welcome  

Below is an example script you can use and tailor when introducing beneficiaries to the Sempo platform. \(Note that this may change depending upon features of your program.\)

> _Welcome! It's wonderful to have you all here today for registration. As you know, we are going to give you money that you can use to buy more items from certain vendor stores over the coming months._ 
>
> _We are giving you contactless "tap to pay" cards. All you'll need to do is go to a participating vendor store, select the items you want to buy, take it to the vendor who will open up the Sempo App and type the amount that you owe them for the item. Hold your card against the vendor's phone still for at least 5 seconds. If you have enough credits, the payment will be confirmed._ 
>
> _Today we have time to register and practice making payments so you are comfortable with the cards and phones. We are going to:  
> \(1\) First collect some information from you and distribute your cards to you, which will  make sure we are sending cards to you  
> \(2\) Practice receiving payments with you  
> \(3\) Explain the payments schedule  
> \(4\) Review the list of vendors in your location that will be participating in this program  
> \(5\) Give you some advice about what to do if you encounter any issues.  
>   
> Are there any questions?”_

## **Gather data for registration \(and legally required “Know Your Customer” \(KYC\) checks, if relevant\)**

Please use the data collection mechanism that your organisation's lead \(or superadmin\) has designed and implemented with Sempo. 

{% page-ref page="decide-your-beneficiary-data-collection-mechanism.md" %}

## **Give beneficiaries their cards \(and/or mobile phones\)**

Distribute the beneficiary their cards and/or mobile phones. When handing out cards to beneficiaries, we advise syncing cards to beneficiaries. 

## **Practice receiving and making payments**

The best way to make sure beneficiaries are comfortable making payments is to make  test payments using very small amounts of money \(for example $0.02 dollars\). We recommend  your team members train beneficiaries using a[ demonstration vendor account. ](../quick-overview-of-enrolling-vendors/plan-your-vendor-in-person-registration-and-training-session.md#creating-a-small-number-of-demonstration-vendor-phone-accounts-and-beneficiary-cards-accounts-for-training-purposes)  
  
An example of how you can explain making payments to beneficiaries is below:

> _You will need to be shopping at a store where the vendor is accepting Sempo payments. When you have selected your items, take them to the vendor and ask to pay with your Sempo card._
>
> _Then the steps will be:_
>
> 1. _The vendor will enter the amount owed into their phone_
> 2. _To make the payment, hold your card still against the back of the phone for 5 seconds until the payment proceeds and you see a tick and "Continue" sign on the vendor phone._
>
> _You will also be able to see your remaining balance on the vendor screen at that time_

## **Explain the disbursement process and schedule**

We recommend explaining the disbursement process until it is clear to beneficiaries when they will be receiving their funds. An example of what you could say is:

> _We will automatically disburse funds to your card on the first Monday of every month._

##  Q&A 

Here are some example answers you can give to potential beneficiary questions:

* **Q: I’ve lost my card. What should I do?** 
  * Answer: Contact our organisation \(or Field Partner\) immediately. We will be able to disable your  account from within the Sempo Dashboard, or ask Sempo for assistance. 
* **Q: I need to ask for a REFUND from a vendor. How do I do this?**
  * Answer: Contact our organisation \(or our Field Partners\) with your name,  card number, the vendor's full name/phone number, the exact amount that needs to be refunded and the reason for refund. Our organisation can work with Sempo to resolve your issue.
