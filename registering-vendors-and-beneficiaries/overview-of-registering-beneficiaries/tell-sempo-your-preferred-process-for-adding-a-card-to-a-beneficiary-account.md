# Set up your process for adding cards to beneficiary accounts

You will have four options for how to add cards to beneficiary accounts, depending upon whether: your team wants to use KoboToolbox vs the Sempo Dashboard for registration; and whether you want to add cards when creating _new_ beneficiary account vs adding cards to a  _pre-existing_ account.

If your team prefers to use KoboToolbox for registration, we can help you:

* Option 1: Add a card while creating a _new_ beneficiary account on registration day via KoboToolbox
* Option 2: Add a card to a _pre-existing_ beneficiary account on registration day via KoboToolbox \(if you have already created accounts during pre-registration interviews\)

If you want to use the Sempo Dashboard for registration, we can help you:

* Option 3: Add a card to a _new_ beneficiary account on registration day via the Dashboard 
* Option 4: Add a card to a _pre-existing_ beneficiary account on registration day via the Dashboard

We do not recommend, but can also enable you to bulk-assign cards to beneficiaries \(Option 5\). 

## Using KoboToolbox

### Option 1: Add a card while creating a _new_ beneficiary account on registration day via KoboToolbox 

If your team is familiar with using KoboToolbox survey forms, we recommend using a single KoboToolbox form to collect all beneficiary data and also add a card to their account during registration day.

Before your beneficiary registration day, please:

1. Agree with your team what [data you want to collect on beneficiaries and how](decide-your-beneficiary-data-collection-mechanism.md)
2. Confirm that [your stack of cards is added to your Platform \(Sempo can pre-add your cards if requested\)](adding-sempo-cards-to-your-platform.md)
3. Set up a KoboToolbox Form for your staff to use when surveying each beneficiary, which includes a question "Please take a card and scan the QR code on the card. \(Example form provided[ here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WZdZ8jL19F3AX0HsSGDvOYBrKLTOP9NA/view?usp=sharing).\)
4. Confirm with Sempo that you have [integrated KoboToolbox ](../../integrations/kobotoolbox.md)with the Sempo Dashboard, so that your forms will automatically sync to Sempo.
5. Explain to your team how to use the KoboToolbox form 

#### Explanation 

Here is an example of what you can say to explain the process to your staff:

> On registration day, you will be given the KoboToolbox Beneficiary Registration form open on a device \(e.g. a mobile phone or tablet\), and a stack of e-voucher cards.   
>   
> We will ask for beneficiaries to form single lines and approach you one-by-one. Using the KoboToolbox Form you will explain the program to beneficiaries and take all relevant information from them. You will then be asked \(by the KoboToolbox Form\) to take an e-voucher card and scan the QR code. \(Please make sure that you only add a card that has not been assigned to anyone else!\)   
>   
> Then you will hand that card to the beneficiary and confirm that they are registered in the program. You will then submit the form on KoboToolbox.
>
> Sempo integrates with [KoboToolbox](../../integrations/kobotoolbox.md), so that when you submit each KoboToolbox form, this information gets automatically added to the Sempo Dashboard.

### Option 2: Add a card to a _pre-existing_ beneficiary account on registration day via KoboToolbox 

If you have already collected information about beneficiaries during pre-registration, you may  want to add a specific card to the beneficiary's account during registration. If your organisation is familiar with KoboToolbox, this option is best.

Before your beneficiary registration day, please

1. Confirm with Sempo if all beneficiaries on the Dashboard will need cards assigned to their accounts \(or which group of them will need cards assigned\)
2. Ask Sempo to create a "Registration List" of beneficiaries, with a unique QR code assigned to each beneficiary \("Registration List"\)
3. Then print off copies of this "Registration List" for each member of your team who will be helping add a card to a beneficiary account  
4. Set up a KoboToolbox Form for your staff to use and deploy it. \(Sempo provides this [template form](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1i3v4h1Ez9qJc76msBrrlk8Juap9Lsl7z/view?usp=sharing) which you can customise.\)
5. Explain to your staff how to use the "Registration List" and KoboToolbox Form to add a card to a beneficiary account before handing that card to the beneficiary 

#### Explanation 

Here is an example of what you can say to explain the process to your staff:

> On registration day, to add a card to a beneficiary's account on Sempo, all you need to do is have access to a printed "Registration List", the KoboToolbox registration form open on a device, and a stack of e-voucher cards.
>
> The "Registration List" will have a list of all beneficiaries that require cards, and a unique QR code next to their names.   
>   
> You will have the KoboToolbox Beneficiary Registration form open on a mobile phone, computer or tablet. \(This form works offline, so you don't need to be connected to the internet.\) The KoboToolbox registration form will only have three questions for you to complete for each beneficiary:
>
> 1. Is the beneficiary's name on the "Registration List"? \(Yes/No\)
> 2. Please scan the beneficiary's QR Code on the Registration List. 
> 3. Please take a card and scan the QR code on the card. 
>
> Then you will give the card to the beneficiary and submit the KoboToolbox form. \(If you have a registration slip to give them, please give the form to them at this stage.\)
>
> Repeat this for each beneficiary.  
>
> Because Sempo integrates with [KoboToolbox](../../integrations/kobotoolbox.md), when you submit each KoboToolbox form, each card will be automatically linked to that beneficiary's account on the Dashboard.

## Using Sempo Dashboard

### Option 3: Add a card to a new beneficiary account via Sempo Dashboard

Please see ["Ways to Register Participants with Sempo &gt; 3. Sempo Dashboard". ](../how-to-register-participants.md#3-sempo-dashboard)

{% page-ref page="../how-to-register-participants.md" %}

### Option 4: Add a card or change card to a pre-existing __beneficiary account via Sempo Dashboard

Please see ["Ways to Register Participants with Sempo &gt; 3. Sempo Dashboard". ](../how-to-register-participants.md#3-sempo-dashboard)However, instead of creating a new account, you will be navigating to the relevant beneficiary's account, clicking on their name and then editing their details. 

### \(Not recommended\) Option 5: Bulk-assign cards to  beneficiaries 

We do not recommend this option, because it can be very hard to find the exact card for each individual and pass it to them during registration.

However, if you would like to try this option \(e.g. because you will be organising alphabetised envelopes for beneficiaries and putting their cards into it\), please contact us at team@withsempo.com to discuss. We can upload a spreadsheet of beneficiary and card details, at your request.
