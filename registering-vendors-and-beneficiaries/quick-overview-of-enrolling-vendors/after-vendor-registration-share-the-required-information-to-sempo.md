# After registration, share vendor data with Sempo Dashboard

## \(If required\) **Share collected vendor information for Sempo to conduct “KYC” checks**

After you have collected all vendor registration information, please share it with Sempo \(team@withsempo.com\), so we can conduct [ “Know Your Customer” \(KYC](../../policies-and-security/kyc.md)\) checks. Please be aware that Sempo may require up to 5 business days to complete the requisite checks \(longer if more information is required from vendors\).

See further:

## **Sync data on vendors to the Sempo Dashboard**

Please use your agreed way to register participants with the Sempo Dashboard. 

{% page-ref page="../how-to-register-participants.md" %}

Sempo can assist you if you have any questions or concerns about the syncing process.
