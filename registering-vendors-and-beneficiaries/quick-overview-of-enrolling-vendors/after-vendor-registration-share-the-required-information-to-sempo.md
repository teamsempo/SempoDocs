# After registration, share vendor data with Sempo and sync to Dashboard

## **Share collected vendor information for Sempo to conduct “KYC” checks**

After you have collected all vendor registration information, please email it in a CSV or Excel format to Sempo \(team@withsempo.com\), so we can conduct [ “Know Your Customer” \(KYC](../../policies-and-security/kyc.md)\) checks. Please be aware that Sempo may require up to 5 business days to complete the requisite checks.

This process may be delayed if Sempo needs to ask you to collect more information about vendors. See further:

{% page-ref page="../../policies-and-security/kyc.md" %}

## **Sync data on vendors to the Sempo Dashboard**

Sempo's partners can always upload and sync data about vendors and program participants on the Sempo Dashboard directly.

Sempo can also assist you if you have any questions or concerns about the syncing process.
