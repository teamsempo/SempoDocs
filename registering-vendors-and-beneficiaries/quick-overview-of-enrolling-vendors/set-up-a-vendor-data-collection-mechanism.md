# Understand your preferred vendor data collection process with Sempo

## **Review and understand what information you need to collect** 

If you have asked Sempo to provide "Know Your Customer" \(KYC\) checks on your participants, Sempo will review the relevant laws and discuss the data requirements with you. By working together with Sempo to collect and share this information, we can make sure that cash is being distributed in accordance with global standards. Please review our explanation of [KYC checks](../../policies-and-security/kyc.md). 

{% page-ref page="../../policies-and-security/kyc.md" %}

In addition to any legally required information, Sempo enables our partners to collect information about participants for tracking and analytics purposes. Please let us know whether you would like to collect such details as:

* Business Category for the Vendor \(e.g. Hardware store, or Fruit Store\) 
* Reason for Vulnerability
* Location

Your team may also want to consider collecting baselining information about your vendors, to monitor any price inflation or business impacts over the course of the program.

{% hint style="success" %}
When your organisation has confirmed what is important for you to collect and analyse, please tell Sempo! We can show you how to use our [Analytics Dashboard](../../monitoring-and-analysing-data/analysing-beneficiary-and-vendor-data.md) to report on what is important to you.
{% endhint %}

## Tell Sempo your preferred vendor data collection mechanism \(e.g.  CSV, KoboToolbox Survey\) 

Sempo can enable registration of participants in four ways \(see [Registering Participants of your Program](../how-to-register-participants.md)\). Importantly, Sempo can receive any CSV or Excel Spreadsheet you provide \(e.g. from KoboToolbox, Commcare etc\), and help you upload it to the Sempo Platform.

If you are unsure about how best to collect data and share it with Sempo, please ask us at [team@withsempo.com](mailto:team@withsempo.com) for help.
