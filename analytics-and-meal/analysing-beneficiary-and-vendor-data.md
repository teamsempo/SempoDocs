# Analysing participant and transfer data

The Sempo analytics dashboard can be used to analyse participant and transfer data. It is also possible to [export a spreadsheet](exporting-to-excel.md) of all payments for further analysis in excel.

It is also important to conduct on-the-ground monitoring to ensure that the program has not resulted in adverse effects, such as beneficiaries being taken advantage of by vendors, or domestic violence due to the distribution.

### Analytics Overview

You can easily view:

* Transaction/ Disbursement Volume over time
* Total figures distributed and spent
* Recipients enrolled
* Categories to break down spend 
* Live transaction feed
* Live Map of transactions

On the analytics page of the dashboard, you'll be able to use tools to: **filter data** \(such as a period of time, age, disability etc.\), **group data by attributes** \(such as location, transfer usage etc.\) and view **data options** \(such as Volume, Transfer Count, Unique Participants, Volume per Participant and Count Per Participant\).

This enables complex and powerful queries to gain new insights into how your programs are performing for monitoring and evaluation. 

> For example, you could generate a query that **displays transaction volume over the current month**, grouped by **transfer usage**. You could filter this data to only display participants who are between the **ages of 25-40**, **female, in the town of Port Villa.**
