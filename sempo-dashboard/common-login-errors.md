# Logging into the Dashboard

## Logging into the Sempo Dashboard

{% hint style="info" %}
You can only log into the Sempo Dashboard once you have signed up for your account. Please ask your organisation to invite you, check your inbox and spam, and please see[ "Signing up for Dashboard Access".](how-to-log-in/)
{% endhint %}

To log in, please:

1. Open an Internet browser and navigate to the webpage of your instance of the Sempo Dashboard. Ask your organisation or Sempo to confirm that URL address if you are unsure. \(It may be "\[your organisation or country region\].withsempo.com"\). 
2. Log in using your email and the password that you used to sign up.

If you are a superadmin or admin, you may also need to use [two-factor authentication](how-to-log-in/) for security reasons before you can log into the Sempo App.
